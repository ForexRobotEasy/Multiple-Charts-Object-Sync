# Multiple Charts Object Sync

This code demonstrates how to synchronize objects across multiple charts in the MQL5 language. It provides a class called `CObjectSync` which manages a collection of synchronized objects.

## How it Works

The code consists of the following classes and functions:

### CObjectSync

This class represents the object synchronization manager. It contains an array `m_objects` to store all the synchronized objects.

#### AddObject(CSynchronizedObject object)

This function is used to add a new object for synchronization. It takes an instance of the `CSynchronizedObject` class as a parameter and adds it to the `m_objects` array.

#### SynchronizeObjects()

This function iterates through all the synchronized objects in the `m_objects` array and calls their `Sync()` function to synchronize them.

### CSynchronizedObject

This class represents a synchronized object. It has members `m_name` to store the object's name and `m_chartID` to store the chart ID where the object is located.

#### CreateObject()

This function is responsible for creating the object on the chart. You can add your own code here to create the object as per your requirements.

#### EditObject()

This function is responsible for editing the object on the chart. You can add your own code here to edit the object as per your requirements.

#### Sync()

This function is used to synchronize the object with other charts. You can add your own code here to implement the synchronization logic.

### Event Handling Functions

The code also includes event handling functions for object creation, object edit, and chart change events. You can customize these functions to handle the respective events as per your requirements.

### OnStart()

This is the main function that starts the synchronization process. It creates an instance of the `CObjectSync` class and adds multiple synchronized objects to it. Then, it calls the `SynchronizeObjects()` function to synchronize the objects.
